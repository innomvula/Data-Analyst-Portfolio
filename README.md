# Data Science Portfolio
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
    - [Play Store Apps](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Playstore%20Apps.ipynb): An analysis of the applications on Google Play (a.k.a the Play Store). There is a large amount of information and insights that could be drawn from the store. Valuable insight can be obtained for app developers to capture the current state of the android market and help and improve the success of the app development business.
    - [Anime Data (Anime News Network)](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Anime%20Data.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of various anime listed on Anime News Network using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
    
- ### Machine Learning - Regression
    - [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Housing%20Prices%20Kaggle%20Challenge.ipynb): Exploration of the features of houses to get an understanding of how they affect housing prices. As well as building and training a model to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa using the Ames Housing dataset.
    - [Predicting Song Ratings](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify_regression_Code.ipynb): Built and trained regression models to predict song genre and popularity based on various song attributes as found on Spotify.
-  ### Machine Learning - Classification
   - [Predicting Song Genres](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify_classification_code_ensemble_Learning.ipynb): Built and trained classification models to predict song genre and popularity based on various song attributes as found on Spotify.
   - [Credit Risk Modelling](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20risk%20modelling%20-%20Predictive%20Models%20(BASE).ipynb): Modelling probability of default of credit card clients in Taiwan based on a variety of demographic and payment information
