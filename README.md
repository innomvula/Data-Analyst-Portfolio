# Data Science Portfolio
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
    - [Play Store Apps](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Anime%20Data.ipynb): An analysis of the applications on Google Play (a.k.a the Play Store) will be carried out. There is a large amount of information and insights that could be drawn from the store. Valuable insight can be obtained for app developers to capture the current state of the android market and help and improve the success of the app development business.
    - [Anime Data (Anime News Network)](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Playstore%20Apps.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of various anime listed on anime news network using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
    
- ### Machine Learning - Regression
    - [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Housing%20Prices%20Kaggle%20Challenge.ipynb): Exploration of the features of houses to get an understanding of how they affect housing prices. As well as building and training a model to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa using the Ames Housing dataset.
    
- ### Deep Learning - Computer Vision
    - [Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/innomvula/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Image%20Classifier%20(MNIST)%20LeNet%20-%205.ipynb): Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the LeNet - 5 architecture to recognize digits from various images of handwritten digits in the classic MNIST dataset (Standard Arabic Numerals).
